# devel 

* Data frame `table64` has been renamed `bidirectional_motifs3` and is now 
properly documented.
* `motif_census_all_triplets()` now only has one parameter, the number of rows is 
computed directly in the C++ function and unit tests have been added. 


# motifcensus 0.1.0

* Initial release, includes `motif_census()` and `motif_census_triplet()`.
